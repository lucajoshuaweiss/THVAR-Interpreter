This projects whole purpose is to learn about interpreters and how to write your own computer language.
The interpreter uses python to interpret my own custom computer language "THVAR".
"THVAR" is NOT a fully developed programming language, therefore it is a computer language.
It uses the file extension ".thvar" and is supposed to be very minimalistic.
"THVAR" stands for "Three Variables", which is why it uses three global variables: 'x', 'y' and 'z'.
Every mathematical operation is built like this: x [operation] y, therefore the mathematical expression 'x+y' is '+' in "THVAR".
'z' is used to safe results.
