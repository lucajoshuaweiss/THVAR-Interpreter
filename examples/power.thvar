p This program is equivalent to z=x^y, where the user can input x and y
/Note: it actually is equivalent to (z*=x)*y, where z is set to 1 at the beginning\
p It uses the zmulx-operator and the loop-operator

p Please give x an int value:
rx
p Please give y an unsigned value:
ry

/The reason for the unsigned value is that if the user uses 0 or a
 negative number the loop will be skipped and zmulx will only be run once\

loop y 
zmulx


p The result is:
res

exit
